1) Download "Node.js"
	Make sure its the latest LTS version
	
2) After running installer and agreeing to terms and 
continuing, go into command prompt (cmd) to check version
	Type "node -v" to see if it installed correctly
	
3) Make a folder wherever and name it whatever; "react-app"
	Inside the folder do *Shift + Right Click* (This is 
	to navigate to PowerShell)
	
4) After being in PowerShell, type "npx create-react-app (name
that you want ex, ease-my-degree-app)

5) Let it do a bunch of stuff and keep installing stuff if 
it says it needs it 

6) Still inside PowerShell, to navigate to the folder,
type, "cd (name of application ex. ease_my_degree-app)

7) Type "npm start" to start application and allow the 
public private thing it prompts you (idk which one to 
press that is more secure)
